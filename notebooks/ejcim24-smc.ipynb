    "The basis is Importance Sampling.\n",
    "The inference launches a series of independent simulations, called _particles_.\n",
    "Each particles computes a value and a score which measures the quality of the particle w.r.t. the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Importance Sampling behaves like a random walk. \n",
    "Each new sample is drawn completely at random regardless of the score of the particle.\n",
    "On the HMM model, at the end of the trajectory, any given particle would have to be extremely lucky to have sampled a trajectory that remains relatively close to all the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this issue, a particle filter periodically _resample_ the set of particle during the execution, duplicating the most relevant particles and discarding the worst ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, to implement this algorithm we need a _checkpointing_ mechanism to interrupt the execution of the particles.\n",
    "At each checkpoint, we can: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. interrupt all the particles, \n",
    "2. resample a new set of particles from their scores, \n",
    "3. reset the scores, \n",
    "4. resume execution until the next checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoints and Python generators\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to implement this checkpointing mechanism is to _hardcode_ the notion of timestep into the model.\n",
